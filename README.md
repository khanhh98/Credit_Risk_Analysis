# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Leanring and Credit Risk

## Overview of the analysis
The analysis focus on using various types of machine learning algorithms and models to predict credit risk of applicants. We will run provided dataset and its features through each model in order to find the most appropriate method and model.
The models used: 
  - Oversampling
  - Under sampling
  - SMOTE Oversampling
  - Combination of Oversampling % Under sampling
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Results
### Naive Radom Oversampling
- Model accuracy score: ~66%
- Predicted High Risk Applicants:
